# Pi-Hole + Unbound on Docker

Initially forked from [chriscrowe/docker-pihole-unbound](https://github.com/chriscrowe/docker-pihole-unbound), now a playground for GitHub Actions testing.

The repo will still provide a Docker image in Docker Hub, you can fetch it with
```console
$ docker pull danidelaria/pihole-unbound:latest
```

The idea is to eventually propose directly to Chris Crowe a PR with GitHub Actions for him to include in his repo.
